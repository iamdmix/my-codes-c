Pointers are those variables who store the memory location of another variable
For example:
    int age = 22
    int *ptr = &aage     Here the * is called value at address operator
                         And the & is called address of operator
    Wherever we use &, we get the address of the variable and 
    Wherever we use *, we get the value of the variable
    int _age = *ptr     So _age will contain the value of age and not it's address
The data type of the pointer and the variable must be same

Format Specifiers:
    • %p stands for pointer adderess. (Usually Hexadecimal)
    • To print it in a relatively more understandable form
    it is type casted to an unsigned integer (%u)

Pointer to Pointer: is a variable that stores the location of a pointer
instead of a single *, ptp will use **.
